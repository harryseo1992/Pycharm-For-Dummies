## Check Python Is Working
If you successfully installed Python, Git, and PyCharm, the first thing you need to do is to check your Python program is working.

In Windows 10, you can check it using Command Prompt.

Follow the order below to open Command Prompt in Windows 10.
1. Press *WIN* ( ![windows-key](https://github.com/harryseo1992/Pycharm-For-Dummies/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/windows_logo.png?raw=true "windows key") ) + *R*.
2. As figure below shows, type "cmd" in the Run window and press *OK*.
![cmd-run](https://github.com/harryseo1992/Pycharm-For-Dummies/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/run_cmd.png?raw=true "Run cmd")

Okay! Let's execute Python in Command Prompt next.
In order to do so, type "python" in your Command Prompt like below.
![cmd-python-implementation](https://github.com/harryseo1992/Pycharm-For-Dummies/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/1.cmd_python_implementation.png?raw=true "Python implementation in cmd")

If you succeeded, you can see the current version of your Python and after that, you will see three close angled brackets(>>>).

The three angled brackets indicates that you are using Python interpreter now.

Let's print "Hello World" using Python.
Type "print("Hello World")" next to the angled brackets, and press *ENTER*.
Then you will see "Hello World" is printed on your screen.
![cmd-python-implementation2](https://github.com/harryseo1992/Pycharm-For-Dummies/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/3.cmd_hello_world.png?raw=true "Python implementation in cmd")

If you successfully followed the steps all the way here, it means your Python is perfectly working.

Type quit() to terminate Python in your Command Prompt.
