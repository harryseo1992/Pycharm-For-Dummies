## Using "Generate..." for Unit Testing

The main navigation for your Just the Docs site is on the left side of the page at large screens and on the top (behind a tap) on small screens. The main navigation can be structured to accommodate a multi-level menu system (pages with children and grandchildren).

By default, all pages will appear as top level pages in the main nav unless a parent page is defined (see [Pages with Children](#pages-with-children)).

The result is shown at [the top of this page](#navigation-structure) (`{:toc}` can be used only once on each page).
