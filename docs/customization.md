## Committing and Pushing Changes

### Introduction

We have all experienced losing our saved work whether by forgetting where we have put them or messing up so bad the file got corrupted. It is also important to save your work when coding as well. To do that, you need to *commit* the changes you have made and *push* the changes to the repository you have cloned.

**See if you can add resolving conflicts parts, manage change lists, or hell pull options as well**

### Steps

1. If you see your files change colour as highlighted below, it means there are changes made that is not saved.

    ![committing_changes](https://github.com/harryseo1992/Pycharm-For-Dummies/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/commit_highlighted.png?raw=true "committing changes")


2. As highlighted below, you will see 3 shapes. Press the *Check-mark shape* to commit.

3. Check the files you want to save.

4. Fill out the changes you have made to those files.

    Simple descriptions that others can understand what changes you have made are best.

    **CAUTION**
    {: .label .label-yellow }
            You may choose to press *commit* here to simply commit the changes you have made. 
            However, in order to **save** the changes you have made to a repository that you cloned from,    
            you must also *push* the changes you made as well. The next step will entail *pushing* changes.
   
5. Press the downward arrow next to *commit button*.

    ![committing_changes](https://github.com/harryseo1992/Pycharm-For-Dummies/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/commit_and_push.png?raw=true "committing changes")


6. Press *commit and push*.

    ![committing_changes](https://github.com/harryseo1992/Pycharm-For-Dummies/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/commit_and_push_finally_pushing.png?raw=true "committing changes")
    You will be led to a new window detailing what will be pushed.

7. Press *push*.

8. Congratulations! You committed and pushed the changes you made to the files! 

    **Recommended**
    {: .label .label-blue } 
            It is a good practice to commit and push often.   
            Committing and pushing after coding a function is ideal.
